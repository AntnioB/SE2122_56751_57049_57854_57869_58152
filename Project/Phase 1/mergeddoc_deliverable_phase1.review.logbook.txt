 Due to bad management of time, our team ended up doing most of the work in the last 2 weeks of
the project. To improve we should work on scheduling more meetings to discuss what we do the
previous week.
 The burndown chart and the backlog from the second sprint don't correspond to all the work that 
had been done that week because the scrum master couldn't deliver them.
