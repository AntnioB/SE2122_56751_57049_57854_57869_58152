As a user I want to scan the bar code on the book, so that I can use it as a reference without having
to manually insert the ISBN.

The actors involved are the user, and the database jabref accesses when adding a new entry via ISBN id.
The use case is the one where we add an entry with an ID where the primary actor is the user and the
secondary actor is the Reference Database.
